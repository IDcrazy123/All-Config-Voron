# kTAMV usage and method comparison

[English](ktamv-usage-comparison.en.md) | [Tiếng Việt](ktamv-usage-comparison.vi.md)

This guide describes the kTAMV integration installed on the five-tool Voron on
2026-08-31 and compares its operator workflow with the retired ToolVision
integration. The reviewed upstream is [TypQxQ/kTAMV](https://github.com/TypQxQ/kTAMV)
at commit `72421f2d54da0de8701c4f84449c6e6b7d060301`. That commit is still upstream
`main`/HEAD and dates from 2024-04-02.

## Current installation

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source | `/home/voron/kTAMV` at reviewed commit `72421f2` |
| Local fixes | `ktamv-multi-object-selection.patch` and `ktamv-center-highlight-fallback.patch` |
| Python | `/home/voron/ktamv-env`, with system OpenCV packages |
| Service | user unit `ktamv-server.service` |
| Server | `http://192.168.1.43:8086/` |
| Processed image | `http://192.168.1.43:8086/image` |
| Source camera | `http://127.0.0.1/webcam/?action=snapshot` |
| Klipper config | `config/Printer-Setup/ktamv.cfg` |
| Cloud upload | `false` |
| Old ToolVision unit | Disabled/removed and followed by `daemon-reload` with sudo |

The upstream installer was deliberately not executed. It changes system time,
runs system-wide `apt`, writes an invalid Moonraker header with an extra `]`,
modifies active printer configuration and restarts services. This machine uses
a pinned manual install and a user service instead.

The user-owned ToolVision runtime, venv, links, generated data and logs were
removed. The old root-owned unit was also removed with the following bounded
commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now tool-vision.service
sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/tool-vision.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## What kTAMV actually does

kTAMV consists of a Klipper extension and a Flask/Waitress image server. The
server resizes each camera frame to 640×480 and tries five upstream OpenCV
preprocessor/detector combinations. The local patch rejects a super-relaxed
keypoint more than 120 pixels from center and uses the compact center highlight
as a sixth fallback. A nozzle position must repeat three times within
`detection_tolerance`; the configured value is zero pixels.

Camera calibration samples ten approximately 0.5 mm points around the starting
position. It needs at least 75% valid samples, filters mm/pixel outliers and
builds a camera-to-printer transform. Centering then detects the nozzle and jogs
X/Y until the computed correction is zero.

Important source observations:

- kTAMV only measures X and Y; it has no Z workflow.
- Camera calibration, transform and origin exist only in RAM.
- `KTAMV_GET_OFFSET` reports `raw current XY - raw origin XY` and does not save.
- `calib_iterations` and `calib_value` are read from config but are not used by
  the reviewed command path.
- `move_speed` is exposed as `printer.ktamv.travel_speed` for macros, but native
  calibration moves use the utility default `F3000` and native centering uses
  `F1000`.
- The README names `KTAMV_MOVE_TO_ORIGIN`, but the reviewed Python does not
  register that command. The repository only supplies a separate example macro,
  which this machine does not include.
- The local `statistics.stdev()` guard returns zero deviation for one remaining
  sample. The caller's 75% retained-point check still rejects that calibration
  cleanly instead of exposing a Python exception.

## Current MF-500 lighting setup

- The camera's supplied/default nozzle illumination is sufficient for the
  detector and is the only lighting assumed by kTAMV/ToolVision. A WCMCU
  eight-pixel WS2812B ring powered independently by an ESP32-C3 Mini is only a
  temporary workaround while the camera light is not mechanically installed;
  it is not connected to Klipper and is not controlled or calibrated.
- `T0_LED` is the separate three-pixel toolhead chain. It produces reflections
  below the nozzle and must be disabled while using the camera:

```gcode
SET_LED LED=T0_LED RED=0 GREEN=0 BLUE=0 TRANSMIT=1
```

- `RESTART` runs `LED_INIT` and may turn the toolhead LEDs back on. Repeat the
  command above before `KTAMV_SETUP`.
- Keep the MF-500 controls at `brightness=0`, `contrast=36`, `gamma=120`.
  Darker brightness/contrast trials made detection worse and were reverted.
- In this scene, the correct marker is the circular white highlight near
  `[336,253]` in the 640×480 processed image. `[192,134]` on the upper-left edge
  of the aluminium block is a false detection and must not be calibrated.

## Command safety classification

### No intentional printer motion

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `KTAMV_SETUP` / `KTAMV_SEND_SERVER_CFG` | Send camera URL and detector options to the server |
| `KTAMV_STATUS` | Report calibrated state, mm/pixel and origin |
| `KTAMV_START_PREVIEW` / `KTAMV_STOP_PREVIEW` | Start/stop image processing preview |
| `KTAMV_SIMPLE_NOZZLE_POSITION` | Detect and report the nozzle pixel position |
| `KTAMV_SET_ORIGIN` | Store current raw X/Y as the reference |
| `KTAMV_GET_OFFSET` | Report current raw X/Y minus the stored origin |
| `KTAMV_APPLY_ACTIVE_TOOL_XY` | Stage the last XY mean in KTC; no motion, separate `SAVE_CONFIG` required |

### Moves the printer

| Command | Motion |
| --- | --- |
| `KTAMV_CALIB_CAMERA` | Ten small X/Y calibration moves and a possible final centering move |
| `KTAMV_FIND_NOZZLE_CENTER` | Repeated X/Y corrections; may wiggle 0.1–0.2 mm after detection loss |
| `KTAMV_MEASURE_ACTIVE_TOOL_XY SAMPLES=3` | Return to the origin at Z40 and center three times, reporting mean/spread |

Both moving commands require X/Y/Z to be homed. They must be run only with an
operator at the printer, the camera and cable secure, all dock paths clear and
an emergency stop ready. A failure does not guarantee exact return to the
starting coordinate.

The 2026-08-31 measurement used operator-approved Z40, disabled each tool LED
and used the camera's supplied/default nozzle illumination. The independent
ESP32-C3/WS2812B ring is a temporary external workaround, not controlled,
assumed or calibrated by kTAMV/ToolVision. Heater targets remained zero.

## Manual comparison workflow

Do not start this sequence merely because installation checks pass. First clean
the nozzle, use soft even lighting, focus on the nozzle hole and keep enough
frame margin for the 0.5 mm pattern.

1. While the machine is idle and attended, home through the normal machine
   workflow and select T0 with X/Y offsets equal to zero.
2. Move T0 near the camera center at a safe Z. Disable `T0_LED`, use the
   camera's supplied/default illumination, then run `KTAMV_SETUP`, preview and
   `KTAMV_SIMPLE_NOZZLE_POSITION`. Continue only when repeated detections mark
   the actual center highlight at the same coordinates.
3. Stop preview and run `KTAMV_CALIB_CAMERA`. Continue only when
   `KTAMV_STATUS` reports calibrated with a valid mm/pixel value.
4. Run `KTAMV_FIND_NOZZLE_CENTER`, then `KTAMV_SET_ORIGIN` exactly once for T0.
5. For each independent cycle, select `T0` then `T1`…`T4`; immediately before
   every sample send `GET_POSITION` and record the dynamic safe pose. After each
   pickup run `KTAMV_MEASURE_ACTIVE_TOOL_XY SAMPLES=1 Z=40 MAX_SPREAD=0.12`.
   Do not infer dock repeatability from three consecutive samples in one pickup;
   keep raw results from at least three complete cycles and compute outer
   median/mean.
6. Only when active/detected tools match, inner spread and T0 return drift pass,
   and all required raw samples exist, run `KTAMV_APPLY_ACTIVE_TOOL_XY` as a
   separate reviewed step. The candidate is `loaded offset + residual`; T0 is
   rejected because it is reference.
7. After reviewing every tool, run `SAVE_CONFIG` once. It restarts Klipper and
   clears the RAM-only camera calibration/origin. Z remains unchanged.

## Local kTAMV source changes

- `ktamv-multi-object-selection.patch` fixes keypoint access and method binding
  when a detector pipeline returns multiple objects.
- `ktamv-center-highlight-fallback.patch` rejects far keypoints, adds a compact
  highlight detector for the MF-500 camera illumination, and guards one-sample
  `stdev`.
- `ktamv-repeat-xy-measurement.patch` stops mm/pixel filtering from mutating
  caller lists, keeps MPP/space/camera removals aligned, returns a consistent
  failure tuple, enforces the real 75% retained threshold on independent motion
  points (excluding the repeated endpoint), and adds native XY state with Z40
  and active/detected-tool guards.

The user-facing measure and apply macros are intentionally separate. Klipper
Jinja renders before the native measurement updates status, and the boundary
also provides an explicit review point before staging configuration.

## kTAMV versus retired ToolVision

| Area | kTAMV | Retired ToolVision integration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Axes | X/Y only | X/Y plus switch or Cartographer Touch Z |
| Image model | Fixed 640×480 OpenCV pipelines | Native-resolution learned profile with ambiguity checks |
| Operator flow | Manual command-by-command | Guided setup and integrated five-tool batches |
| Persistence | None across Klipper restart | State, latest result and history on disk |
| Statistics | Single observations; operator repeats/records | Batch attempts and per-tool statistics |
| Apply behavior | Reports only | Configured report-only on this printer |
| Recovery | Limited; native commands may leave a shifted position | KTC restore verification and cleanup evidence |
| Updates | Pinned/manual because of a local patch | Previously managed by Moonraker |

The three-cycle raw evidence is stored at
`extras/experiments/ktamv-xy-independent-cycles-20260831.md`; T3 has one
first-cycle X outlier, so outer-cycle statistics are required. The comparison
is not a claim that one detector is universally better. On this
specific MF-500 setup, both systems saw ambiguous reflective features. The
2026-08-22 kTAMV calibration accepted only six of ten points; its processed
marker sat on a bright reflection below the actual nozzle hole, and one accepted
scale (`0.028`) was an outlier from the `0.041–0.044` cluster. ToolVision also
rejected the scene as multiple nozzle-like objects. Improve the optical scene
before any new attended motion test.

## Processed image in Mainsail

Add a separate webcam entry if desired:

- name: `kTAMV Processed`;
- stream URL: empty;
- snapshot URL: `http://192.168.1.43:8086/image`;
- service: Adaptive MJPEG-Streamer;
- target FPS: 2–4.

Use the printer IP, not `localhost`, because Mainsail resolves the URL in the
browser. This view is detector output and does not replace the original MF-500
camera entry.

## Non-motion verification and troubleshooting

Host checks:

```bash
systemctl --user status ktamv-server
journalctl --user -u ktamv-server -n 100 --no-pager
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:8086/
```

After Klipper loads the config, `KTAMV_STATUS`, `CALIBRATION_STATUS` and
`CHECK_OFFSETS` are non-motion checks. `Camera URL not set` is resolved by
`KTAMV_SETUP`. `No nozzle found` requires optical correction, not blindly
raising tolerance. More than 25% failed camera points is a hard stop: do not
continue to centering or offset collection.

Restarting Klipper clears calibration and origin by design. The runtime has no
automatic persistence or offset writeback.

After the 2026-08-31 lighting change, static checks before and after `RESTART`
both returned `[336,253]` in 5.42/5.09 seconds. Calibration was not repeated
because it moves the printer and the restart cleared the homed state.
